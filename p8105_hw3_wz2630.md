## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

There are 1,384,617 observations and 15 variables in the ‘instacart’
dataset. 4 of 15 are character data type and the remaining is integer
data type. Key variables include order_id, product_id, user_id,
product_name, aisle_id, department_id, not including all. \# what are
illustrative examples?

``` r
# How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?
aisle_count = 
  instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

There are 134 aisles. Fresh vegetables (aisle_id = 83) and fresh fruits
(aisle_id = 24) have the most items ordered. Fresh vegetables aisle have
150,609 items ordered and fresh fruits aisle have 150,473 items ordered.

``` r
# Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> #fct_reorder turns aisle into factor variables based on count, n
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, color = "navy"))
```

``` r
# Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table

  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  # min_rank gives the same rank to ties based on product_names we counted; ranking function
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  # we want top 3 products
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable() # returns a table
```

# Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table)

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the

## Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Data cleaning

``` r
brfss = 
  brfss_smart2010 |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"), topic == "Overall Health") |> 
  mutate(response = factor(response, 
                           levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor", ordered = TRUE)))
```

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010?

``` r
brfss |> 
  filter(year == 2002) |> 
  group_by(locationabbr) |> 
  summarise(locations_count = n_distinct(locationdesc)) |> 
  filter(locations_count >= 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 2
    ##   locationabbr locations_count
    ##   <chr>                  <int>
    ## 1 CT                         7
    ## 2 FL                         7
    ## 3 MA                         8
    ## 4 NC                         7
    ## 5 NJ                         8
    ## 6 PA                        10

``` r
brfss |> 
  filter(year == 2010) |> 
  group_by(locationabbr) |> 
  summarise(locations_count = n_distinct(locationdesc)) |> 
  filter(locations_count >= 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 14 × 2
    ##    locationabbr locations_count
    ##    <chr>                  <int>
    ##  1 CA                        12

    ##  3 FL                        41
    ##  4 MA                         9
    ##  5 MD                        12
    ##  6 NC                        12
    ##  7 NE                        10
    ##  8 NJ                        19
    ##  9 NY                         9
    ## 10 OH                         8
    ## 11 PA                         7
    ## 12 SC                         7
    ## 13 TX                        16
    ## 14 WA                        10

In 2002, **6** states were observed at 7 or more locations. Those states
are **CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, PA**.

In 2010, **14** states were observed at 7 or more locations. Those
states are **CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA**.

Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for
each state across years – the geom_line geometry and group aesthetic
will help).

``` r
excellent_responses = 
  brfss |> 
  filter(response == "Excellent") |>
  group_by(year, locationabbr) |> 
  summarise(data_value_avg = mean(data_value))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
# spaghetti plot:
excellent_responses |> 
  rename("State" = locationabbr) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = data_value_avg, color = State)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = .5) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Average Data Values", 
       title = "Average data values across years for each state") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_wz2630_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="90%" />

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State

two_panel_plot = brfss \|\> filter(year %in% c(2006, 2010)) \|\>
pivot_longer( Poor:Excellent, names_to = “state”, values_to =
“repsonse”) \|\> ggplot(aes(x = year, y = response, color = response)) +
geom_boxplot() + facet_grid(.~year)
